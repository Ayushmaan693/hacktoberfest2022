HERE’S HOW WE VALIDATE CONTRIBUTOR PULL/MERGE REQUESTS (“PR/MRS”) FOR HACKTOBERFEST

### **[CONSIDERED OUT-OF-BOUND]**
YOUR PR/MRS MUST BE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF HACKTOBERFEST.
~~~
Your PR/MRs must be created between October 1 and October 31 (in any time zone, UTC-12 thru UTC+14).

Your PR/MRs must be made to a public, unarchived repository.
~~~
### **[SPAM]**
YOUR PR/MRS MUST NOT BE SPAMMY
~~~
PR/MRs that are labeled with a label containing the word “spam” by maintainers will not be counted.

We use the Node.js 16 RegEx engine with /\bspam\b/i to look for spam labels.

PR/MRs that also have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label cannot be marked as spammy via a label.

PR/MRs that have been merged and do not have a label containing the word “invalid” cannot be marked as spammy via a label.

PR/MRs that our system detects as spammy will also not be counted.

Any user with two or more spammy PR/MRs will be disqualified.
~~~
### **[INVALID]**
YOUR PR/MRS MUST NOT BE LABELED AS “INVALID”
~~~
PR/MRs that have a label containing the word “invalid” won’t be counted, unless they also have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label.

Specifically, we use the Node.js 16 RegEx engine with /\binvalid\b/i to look for invalid labels.
~~~
### **[ACCEPTED]**
YOUR PR/MRS MUST BE MERGED, HAVE THE “HACKTOBERFEST-ACCEPTED” LABEL, OR HAVE AN OVERALL APPROVING REVIEW.
~~~
Your PR/MR must not be a draft to be considered accepted.

If your PR/MR is being accepted for Hacktoberfest via an overall approving review it must also not be closed.
~~~
### **[PR/MRS APPROVING BY HACKTOBERFEST]**
ONCE YOUR PR/MRS PASS ALL THE CHECKS ABOVE, IT WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR HACKTOBERFEST AFTER THE 7-DAY REVIEW PERIOD
~~~
We continually evaluate all of the checks except the [PARTICIPATING] check. If it fails any of these checks during this time, the 7-day timer will reset.

After the 7-day review period completes, your PR/MR will be automatically accepted for Hacktoberfest assuming it still passes all the checks. Once accepted for Hacktoberfest, we stop checking. :party:
